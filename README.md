## Responsive refresh userscript

A [userscript](http://userscripts.org/) to assist you in your responsive devs

### ?

Our latest responsive site is partially responsive from the server side rendering.

This script automatically refresh the page with the proper device format, as you resize the page.

I've started the same project as a [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/jobwat/refresh-on-resize-chrome-extension) first but couldn't get the viewport dimensions, only the window ones.
